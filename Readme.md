# ! STILL EXPERIMENTAL!

# ❤️‍🔥 SvelteKit + Golang = Binary

When you want to write a small service, with your favourite frameworks (Golang + Svelte), then use this repository as a template for your project. No Kubernetes needed, everything gets compiled into one binary, assets and html included.

## 🚧 Current Features / Current Status:

- Svelte handles all frontend requests (like 200, 404,...)
- It can use dynamic routing /users/\[name\]
- assets can be shown but can still overwrite svelte runtime files :warning:
- gorelease can release its version, based on semantic versioning. Commits have to follow a specific structure, [see here](https://github.com/thenativeweb/get-next-version)
- no live reloading
