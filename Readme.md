</div>

Golang and Svelte are some truely beautiful technologies and very powerful. But sometimes it is just overkill to deploy a docker compose stack or kubernetes cluster yet.

But don't worry, with this repository, I'm giving you the chance to make your infrastructure grow as your project. You start as a single binary that can be distributed and published like gitea and later you can deploy is as independent microservices.

## Why you should use this Template?

- Project architecture is already ready to implement
  - Golang Backend just works
  - Svelte Frontend just works
  - Hotreload is working
- Database Schema can be migrated automatically or via command `app migrate up`
